<h4 STYLE="COLOR:SaddleBrown";> Title of the project	: Analysis of Cascaded Five Level Multilevel Inverter Using Hybrid Pulse 
Width Modulation </h4>
<h4 STYLE="COLOR:SaddleBrown";> Team members	: 3<br>
Software 		: MATLAB, SIMLINK<br>
Description	: Multilevel inverter is an effective and practical solution for increasing power demand and reducing 
harmonics of AC waveforms. 
Such inverters synthesize a desired output voltage from several levels of dc voltages as inputs.
 This paper analyzes the performance of cascaded five level inverter using hybrid pulse width modulation technique. 
It has been found that this technique reduces the switching losses and total harmonic distortion. 
The topology used in this technique reduces the number of power switches 
when compared to the conventional cascaded Hbridge multilevel inverter. 
The performance has been analyzed by the MATLAB/Simulink. 
The output shows better performance results.  </h4><br><hr>
