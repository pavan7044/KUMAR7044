<h1 style="color:red;font-family:MV Boli";>E - TORO</h1>
</center>

<h3 style="color:black";> E - Toro was founded as RetailFX in 2006 in Tel Aviv, by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia together with David Ring.[1][7]

In 2010, eToro released the eToro OpenBook social investment platform, along with its "Copy-Trading" feature. The eToro OpenBook enables investors to view, follow and copy the network's top traders automatically.[8] Later that year, eToro released its first Android apps so investors could buy and sell stock via mobile devices.[9]

Between 2007 and 2013, the company raised $31.5 million in four rounds of funding.[10][11][12] In December 2014, eToro raised $27 million from Russian and Chinese investors.[13]</h3>

<h3 style="color:black";> Prior to the advent of the Internet, investors had to call up their stockbroker and place an order on the telephone. The brokerage firm would then enter the order in their system which was linked to trading floors and exchanges.

In 1985, Trade*Plus offered a retail trading platform on America Online and Compuserve, and in 1991 one of its founders, William Porter, created a new subsidiary company called E*Trade Securities, Inc.[1]

In August 1994, K. Aufhauser & Company, Inc. (later acquired by TD Ameritrade) became the first brokerage firm to offer online trading via its "WealthWEB".[2] Online investing has experienced significant growth since that time. Investors could now enter orders directly online, or even trade with other investors via electronic communication networks (ECN). Some orders entered online are still routed through the broker, allowing agents to approve or monitor the trades. This step assists in the protection of both the client and brokerage firm from unlawful or incorrect trades which could affect the client’s portfolio or the stockbroker’s license; this doesn’t signify that trading made within state’s law limits is also permitted in a moral religious context as the social and legal endorsement does not exempt each individual from moral responsibility to avoid speculative forms morally reprehensible.


Online brokers in the US are often referred to as discount brokers but in Europe and Asia many so-called online brokers work with High-net-worth individuals. Their popularity is attributable to the speed and ease of their online order entry, and to fees and commissions significantly lower than those of full service brokerage firms within the US.

Two types of online brokerages have emerged in the US in the mid 2000s. One type of brokerage offering Direct-access trading to exchanges, such as Interactive Brokers. While the other type of brokerage, such as TD Ameritrade route orders to Market maker firms to have their orders filled. An example of a Market Maker firm was Knight Capital Group, now known as KCG Holdings.</h3>
